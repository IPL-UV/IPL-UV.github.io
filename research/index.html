The description of such a complex system needs of the integration of different disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and other applied sciences, leading to what has been coined as Earth System Science (ESS). The analysis of the Earth system involves studying interacting processes occurring in several spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, pedosphere, biosphere, and magnetosphere) as well as the anthroposphere where the Society acts.<h2><a href=/research/earth_science/>Earth and climate sciences</a></h2>Motivation Machine learning has yielded many successful results and developments in remote sensing, geosciences and climate sciences. However, there are still strong limitations for the general adoption of machine learning algorithms for predicting and understanding the Earth and climate systems.
The current statistical treatment of biophysical parameters is strongly limited by the quantity and quality of EO data, as well as because of the abuse of standard off-the-shelf methods, which in general are not well-adapted to the particular EO data characteristics.<h2><a href=/research/visual_brain/>Image and Video Processing: Scene Statistics and Visual Neuroscience at work!</a></h2>Efficient coding of visual information and efficient inference of missing information in images depend on two factors:
The statistical structure of photographic images, and The nature of the observer that will analyze the result. Interestingly, these two factors (image regularities and human vision) are deeply related since the evolution of biological sensors seems to be guided by statistical learning (see our work on the Efficient Coding Hypothesis in Visual Neuroscience). However, the simultaneous consideration of these two factors is unusual in the image processing community, particularly beyond Gaussian image models and linear models of the observer.<h2><a href=/research/philosophy/>Philosophy, Goal, Vision</a></h2>Context Complex systems are ubiquitous: from the Earth&rsquo;s global climate and the human brain, to society and economic systems. The analysis and characterization of complex systems is very challenging: many processes are involved, exhibiting highly nonlinear, dynamic, and networked relations. Different physical, chemical and biological processes interact in several spheres, and at diverse spatio-temporal scales. When data and domain knowledge are available, exploiting regularities through statistical machine learning is certainly an outstanding opportunity.<h2><a href=/research/machine_learning/>Research Machine Learning</a></h2>Motivation Machines may extract knowledge from measurements by analyzing the statistical properties of the acquired signals. The aim is to capture the structures in the experimental data. Our contributions to machine learning include algorithms for automatic classification (recognition) of objects, robust regression tools for multidimensional data, density estimation algorithms, and feature extraction and selection. We study the principled design of learning algorithms, specially neural networks and kernel methods. Methods are designed for general purposes but also specific to the application, most of them related to image processing, computer vision tasks and Earth science data analysis, but also non-structured data in social sciences.<h2><a href=/research/visual_neuroscience/>Vision Science: from Optics to Neuroscience and Statistical Learning</a></h2>Vision is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment by analyzing the measurements drawn by imaging systems. This ability is particularly impressive in humans compared to the current state of the art in computers.
The study of all phenomena related to vision in biological systems (particularly in humans) is usually referred to as Vision Science. It addresses a variety of issues ranging from the formation of the visual signal—such as the physics of the imaging process, which includes Radiometry and Physiological Optics—to the analysis of the visual signal, which is of interest for Neuroscience and Psychology.</div></main></body><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous defer></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pcooksey/bibtex-js@1.0.0/src/bibtex_js.min.js defer></script></html>
