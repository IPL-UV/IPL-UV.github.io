The analysis and characterization of complex systems is very challenging: many processes are involved, exhibiting highly nonlinear, dynamic, and networked relations. Different physical, chemical and biological processes interact in several spheres, and at diverse spatio-temporal scales. When data and domain knowledge are available, exploiting regularities through statistical machine learning is certainly an outstanding opportunity.</description></item></channel></rss>
