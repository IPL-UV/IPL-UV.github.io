However, there are still strong limitations for the general adoption of machine learning algorithms for predicting and understanding the Earth and climate systems.
The current statistical treatment of biophysical parameters is strongly limited by the quantity and quality of EO data, as well as because of the abuse of standard off-the-shelf methods, which in general are not well-adapted to the particular EO data characteristics.</description></item><item><title>Research Machine Learning</title><link>https://ipl-uv.github.io/research/machine_learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ipl-uv.github.io/research/machine_learning/</guid><description>Machine learning Motivation Machines may extract knowledge from measurements by analyzing the statistical properties of the acquired signals. The aim is to capture the structures in the experimental data. Our contributions to machine learning include algorithms for automatic classification (recognition) of objects, robust regression tools for multidimensional data, density estimation algorithms, and feature extraction and selection. We study the principled design of learning algorithms, specially neural networks and kernel methods. Methods are designed for general purposes but also specific to the application, most of them related to image processing, computer vision tasks and Earth science data analysis, but also non-structured data in social sciences.</description></item><item><title>Research Social Science</title><link>https://ipl-uv.github.io/research/social_science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ipl-uv.github.io/research/social_science/</guid><description>AI for sustainability and social sciences Motivation The Earth is a highly complex, dynamic, and networked system where very different physical, chemical and biological processes interact, to form the world we know. The description of such a complex system needs of the integration of different disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and other applied sciences, leading to what has been coined as Earth System Science (ESS). The analysis of the Earth system involves studying interacting processes occurring in several spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, pedosphere, biosphere, and magnetosphere) as well as the anthroposphere where the Society acts.</description></item><item><title>Visual Brain</title><link>https://ipl-uv.github.io/research/visual_brain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ipl-uv.github.io/research/visual_brain/</guid><description>Image and Video Processing:
Scene Statistics and Visual Neuroscience at work!
Controversies: don't use (1) the Mean Squared Error, nor (2) the image of Lena S&amp;oumlderberg. Here we only talk about the MSE issue.
MPEG-like video compression is based on predictive coding: i.e. motion compensation and residual quantization. Motion compensation consist of optical flow estimation (M module) and motion-based prediction (P module).Residuals (prediction errors) are analyzed in a different domain (T module) and quantized therein (Q module).</description></item><item><title>Visual Neuroscience</title><link>https://ipl-uv.github.io/research/visual_neuroscience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ipl-uv.github.io/research/visual_neuroscience/</guid><description>Vision Science:
from Optics to Neuroscience and Statistical Learning
The PSF of this nice human eye can be measured in-vivo [Opth.Phys.Opt.97].
Linear V1 cells (see model here [Front.Neurosci.15]).
Linear response of MT cells
(and see the CODE for V1 and MT cells HERE) Vision is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment by analyzing the measurements drawn by imaging systems. This ability is particularly impressive in humans when compared to the current state of the art in computers .</description></item></channel></rss>
