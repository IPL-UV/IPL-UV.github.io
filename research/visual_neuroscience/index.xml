This ability is particularly impressive in humans compared to the current state of the art in computers.
The study of all phenomena related to vision in biological systems (particularly in humans) is usually referred to as Vision Science. It addresses a variety of issues ranging from the formation of the visual signal, such as the physics of the imaging process, which includes Radiometry and Physiological Opticsâ€”to the analysis of the visual signal, which is of interest for Neuroscience and Psychology.</description></item></channel></rss>
