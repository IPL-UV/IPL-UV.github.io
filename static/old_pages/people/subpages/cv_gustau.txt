Gustau Camps-Valls (IEEE Fellow'18, ELLIS Fellow, IEEE Distinguished lecturer, PhD in Physics) is a Full professor in Electrical Engineering at the Universitat de Val\`encia. He is interested in the development of AI and causal inference algorithms for modeling and understanding the Earth system. He is an author of around 300 journal papers, more than 300 conference papers, 25 international book chapters, and editor of 6 books on kernel methods and deep learning, with emphasis on geosciences and remote sensing data analysis. He holds a Hirsch's index h=90 (Google Scholar), a Highly Cited Researcher since 2020, and Thomson Reuters ScienceWatch identified one of his papers on kernel-based analysis of hyperspectral images as a Fast Moving Front research. He received two European Research Council (ERC) grants: an ERC Consolidator grant on "Statistical learning for Earth observation data analysis" (2015) and an ERC Synergy grant on "Understanding and Modelling the Earth system with machine learning" (2019). In 2016 he was included in the prestigious IEEE Distinguished Lecturer program of the IEEE GRSS. In 2021 he became a Member of the ESSC panel part of the European Science Foundation (ESF), and in 2022 was elevated to Fellow of the European Academy of Sciences (EurASc), Fellow of the Academia Europeae (AE), and Fellow of Asia-Pacific Artificial Intelligence Association (AAIA).
