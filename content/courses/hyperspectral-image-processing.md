**Course Duration:** 60 hours  
**Instructor:** G. Camps-Valls

We introduce the main concepts of hyperspectral image processing. We start by a soft introduction to hyperspectral image processing, the standard processing chain, and the current challenges in the field. Then we analyze the current state of the art in several topics: feature extraction, supervised classification, unmixing and abundance estimation, and retrieval of biophysical parameters. All the methods and techniques studied are reviewed both theoretically and through MATLAB exercises.
