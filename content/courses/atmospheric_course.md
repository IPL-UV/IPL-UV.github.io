Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Models (RTM) are computer codes that describe the physical interaction of light with atmospheric constituents, helping us to understand the radiation processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere. These models are widely used in Earth Observation scientific and technological applications, from retrieval of atmospheric parameters, to processing satellite data and numerical weather forecasting.
