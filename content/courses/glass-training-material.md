The GLaSS training material builds on the global lakes use cases of GLaSS. It allows students and professionals in fields such as aquatic ecology, environmental technology, remote sensing, and GIS to learn about the possibilities of optical remote sensing of water quality, by using the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites and Landsat 8.
