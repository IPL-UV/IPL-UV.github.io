**Course Duration:** 30 hours  
**Instructor:** J. Malo

In this course, I introduce the facts on color vision from radiometry and photometry, the vision of spatio-temporal textures, the models of mechanisms and circuits that (kind of) reproduce these facts, and the statistical elements of theories that explain the facts.
