The awarded 2019 European Research Council (ERC) Synergy Grant USMILE aims to advance understanding and modeling of the Earth system with machine learning (ML), one of the important approaches of artificial intelligence (AI). The prestigious award will support the teamâ€™s groundbreaking work in rethinking the development and evaluation of Earth system models, which are the basis for understanding and projecting climate change.
