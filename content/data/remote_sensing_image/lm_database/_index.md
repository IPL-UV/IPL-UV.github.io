The database contains 7 million multispectral images from the MSG sensor. Images correspond to 200 landmark locations in the globe during 2010. They are fully labeled with cloud vs cloudfree classes. The main goal is the automatic detection of clouds over landmarks, which is a challenging classification problem.
