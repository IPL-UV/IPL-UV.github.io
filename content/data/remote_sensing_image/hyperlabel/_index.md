description: |
  The Image and Signal Processing (ISP) group at the Universitat de València has harmonized a big database of labeled multi- and hyperspectral images for testing classification algorithms. We provide training pairs (spectra and their labels) and test spectra. Researchers are able to train their algorithms off-line, and then evaluate their accuracy over an independent, fixed, spectra test set per image. The system returns accuracy and robustness measures of your algorithm in that test set, as well as a ranked list of the best methods.
