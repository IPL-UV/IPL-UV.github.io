  # About the Color Image Database
  The database consists of **130 calibrated color images** of **natural objects** under **calibrated illuminations**:
  - **Calibrated images**: images are given in CIE XYZ tristimulus values.
  - **Natural objects**: imply complex textures, mutual illumination, and shadows, which induce non-linear effects in the tristimulus values.
  - **Calibrated illuminations**: include diffuse CIE D65 and diffuse CIE A illuminant.
  
  The database is suitable for accurate studies on **color image statistics**, **chromatic adaptation** in natural environments, and **color constancy**.

  # Why a New Color Image Database?
  This color image database was collected in the context of a **chromatic adaptation study** based on **color statistics**. The following facts are relevant:
  - The proper way to describe the physical input to any (artificial or human) visual system involves either (i) absolute radiances, hyperspectral images, or (ii) absolute tristimulus images.
  - Even if the spectral reflectance of objects is known, the simple flat-Lambertian world assumption is not valid due to **mutual illumination**, **shadows**, and **specular reflections**.
  - Accurate results on chromatic adaptation, such as **corresponding pairs** data, require a continuous distribution of samples in the tristimulus space, which necessitates a wide enough ensemble of natural reflectances.
  
  Existing color databases have several limitations:
  - **Uncalibrated data** (digital counts from conventional cameras instead of radiances or tristimulus values).
  - **Spectroradiometric databases** often do not include reflectance but estimate it using a white reference sample, and scenes may not be available under both CIE D65 and CIE A illuminants.
  - The above is also true for the available tristimulus image databases.
  
  Given these issues, this **calibrated database** includes a wide set of natural objects under a pair of calibrated illuminants.

  # Calibration and Experimental Procedure
  The images were taken using a **Macbeth Executive light chamber** equipped with standard **CIE D65** and **CIE A** illuminants, and a calibrated image colorimeter **Lumicam1300**. Key details:
  - **Exposure time** for each filter (X, Y, Z) was adjusted to avoid over or under-exposure, ensuring optimal operating range for the camera.
  - Pictures with **misregistered channels** (due to motion) or scenes outside the camera's operating range were discarded.
  
  Accuracy was verified by capturing 10 hue pages of the **Munsell Book of Color** and comparing the measured **CIE xy chromaticities** with theoretical values computed from known reflectances. The accuracy of **luminance** was roughly within the limits provided by the manufacturer (~3%).

  # Organization of the Database

  The database includes **65 different scenes of natural objects** under two illuminants (**130 images**) plus **10 scenes** displaying different hue pages of the **Munsell Book of Color** (**20 images**). The image size is **1000x1280 pixels**. The images are classified as follows:
