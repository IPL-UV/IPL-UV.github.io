abstract: "The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) is a multi-frequency passive microwave mission, planned for launch in 2029. We discuss the design of operational L2 algorithms for soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) retrievals from L-, C-, and X-band microwave observations."
