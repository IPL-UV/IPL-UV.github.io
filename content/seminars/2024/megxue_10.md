abstract: "We will discuss four examples that Bayesian hybrid modeling may enhance drought detection and understanding. First, it helps learn challenging joint distributions, especially when labels are scarce and imbalanced. Second, it aids in estimating physical variables. Third, Bayesian inference allows for DL model calibration and uncertainty assessment, alleviating overconfidence and rejecting uncertain variabilities. Lastly, Bayesian statistics facilitate the interaction of explanations and uncertainties to advance our understanding of DL drought detection."
