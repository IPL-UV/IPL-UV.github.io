abstract: "Pari Island is a small island in Indonesia, north of Jakarta. Previous studies have considered the impacts of climate change on Pari Island, for example in relation to flooding. Here, we outline the overlooked impacts of marine heatwaves in the region, their connection to climate change and the associated ecological and social impacts on coral reefs, (grouper) fish and the tourism-dependant economy."
