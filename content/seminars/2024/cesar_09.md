abstract: "Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in climate and earth observation, primarily driven by machine learning algorithms. The key to the success of these algorithms lies in the quantity and quality of the datasets used. Paradoxically, creating large, high-quality datasets remains one of machine learning development's most undervalued and overlooked aspects. The current state indicates that finding the right dataset for the task at hand can be challenging, and few (if any) datasets fully adhere to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) guidelines. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Taco specification, a new standard to facilitate the creation of fully FAIR Earth Observation and Climate datasets. Taco is inspired by the specifications of Croissant Responsible AI (RAI) and the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC). Additionally, it incorporates naming conventions from the OGC Training Data Markup Language. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Taco, we have converted all existing cloud detection datasets to this new standard, resulting in the largest multi-sensor and multi-temporal dataset, consisting of over 200,000 human-labeled images."
