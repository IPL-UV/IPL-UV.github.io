abstract: "Average and conditional treatment effects are fundamental causal quantities to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in various critical applications, including clinical settings and policy-making. Taking aside the gold-standard estimators obtained with randomized trials, multiple methods have been proposed to estimate treatment effects using observational data. Here, we show how a class of graphical models, termed staged event trees, can be effectively used for the aforementioned causal inference tasks. These models offer the advantage of being easily interpretable, enhancing their utility in practical applications. We implement classical estimators using staged event trees and showcase their capabilities through simulation studies and real-world applications."
