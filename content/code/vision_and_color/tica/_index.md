Topographic Independent Component Analysis (TICA) is a method for learning topographically organized features from visual data. It extends the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm by incorporating spatial proximity, aiming to model how neurons in the visual cortex represent information with localized and continuous receptive fields. TICA has been applied to understand orientation domains in the brain's visual cortex, but studies have shown that the model may produce discontinuous, scrambled orientation maps, contradicting experimental observations.
