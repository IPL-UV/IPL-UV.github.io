The Wilson-Cowan interaction of wavelet-like visual neurons is analyzed in total correlation terms for the first time. Theoretical and empirical results show that a psychophysically-tuned interaction achieves the biggest efficiency in the most frequent region of the image space. This an original confirmation of the Efficient Coding Hypothesis and suggests that neural field models can be an alternative to Divisive Normalization in image compression.
