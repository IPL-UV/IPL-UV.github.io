The rotated complex kernel PCA (ROCK-PCA) works in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to account for nonlinear processes, operates in the complex domain to handle both spatial and temporal features and time-lagged correlations. It adds an extra rotation for improved flexibility and physical consistency, providing an explicitly resolved spatio-temporal decomposition of Earth and climate data cubes.
