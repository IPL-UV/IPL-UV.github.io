The ViStaCoRe Coding Package is a Matlab Toolbox for achromatic and color image compression that includes a set of transform coding algorithms based on (1) Human Vision Models of different accuracy, and (2) coefficient selection through Sparse Regression in local frequency domains (in particular SVR). The ViStaCoRe Restoration Package is a Matlab Toolbox for image restoration that includes (1) classical regularization techniques, (2) classical wavelet thresholding techniques, (3) regularization functionals based on non-linear Human Vision models, and (4) denoising techniques based on Kernel regression in wavelet domains.
