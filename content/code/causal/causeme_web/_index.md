  Detecting causal associations in time series datasets is key for novel insights into complex dynamical systems like the Earth system or the human brain. The CauseMe platform provides benchmark datasets with ground truth, featuring different real data challenges to assess and compare causal discovery methods. The available datasets vary in dimensionality, complexity, and sophistication, allowing researchers to evaluate their methods in a consistent manner.
