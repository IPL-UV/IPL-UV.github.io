The Image and Signal Processing (ISP) group at the Universitat de Val√®ncia has harmonized a big database of labeled multi- and hyperspectral images for testing classification algorithms. We have harmonized 43 image datasets, both multi- and hyperspectral, for objective evaluation of algorithms and submitted papers. Researchers can train their algorithms off-line, and evaluate their accuracy on independent spectra test sets. The system returns accuracy and robustness measures, as well as a ranked list of the best methods.
