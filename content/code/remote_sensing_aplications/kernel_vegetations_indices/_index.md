Empirical vegetation indices derived from spectral reflectance data are widely used in remote sensing of the biosphere. Here we generalize the family of commonly used vegetation indices by exploiting all higher-order relations between spectral channels. This results in higher sensitivity to vegetation biophysical and physiological parameters, improving the monitoring of key parameters such as leaf area index and gross primary productivity.
