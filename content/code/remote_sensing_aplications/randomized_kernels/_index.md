  Kernel methods are powerful machine learning algorithms, widely used in remote sensing and geosciences. This paper introduces an efficient kernel method for fast statistical retrieval of atmospheric and biophysical parameters. The method approximates a kernel matrix with projections on random bases sampled from the Fourier domain.
