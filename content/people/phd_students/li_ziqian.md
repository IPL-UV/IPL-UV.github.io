I am a PhD student specializing in crop classification and diurnal photosynthesis monitoring. My research combines Sentinel-2 and GEDI data for crop type mapping, and utilizes FY-4A geostationary satellite observations to investigate midday photosynthetic depression and drought responses in winter wheat and maize.
