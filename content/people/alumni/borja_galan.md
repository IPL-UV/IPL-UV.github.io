My research was tied to study feature representations that are sparse, interpretable and causal. At ISP I have been working in the Causal inference in the human-biosphere coupled system (SCALE) project funded by BBVA and the EC H2020 DeepCube project developing modules for interpretability and explainability in ML models.
