I am broadly interested in developing machine learning methods for complex dynamical systems, including but not limited to stochastic generative models, dimensionality reduction, causality, Bayesian statistical methods, Earth climate applications. At ISP, I will particularly focus on implementation and testing of new ML-based parameterizations for Earth system models.
