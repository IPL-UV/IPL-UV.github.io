I hold a PhD in Theoretical Particle Physics. My current research focuses on developing multimodal foundation models for Earth observation within the ELLIOT project,. Previously, I applied deep learning to multivariate time series forecasting, downscaling of air quality data and reconstruction of climate variables.
