I am a final year PhD student in the Oxford Computational Statistics and Machine Learning group at the University of Oxford. I am interested in developing simple and interpretable statistical ML methodologies to address challenges that arise in climate science, in particular on climate model emulation using physically-informed models and statistical downscaling. I use mostly kernel methods and Gaussian processes.
