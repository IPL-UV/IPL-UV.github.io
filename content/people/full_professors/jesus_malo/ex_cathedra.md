title: "First words ex-cathedra"

    # JesÃºs Malo (San Francisco, Starbucks at 390 Stockton St., February 2015)

    Circa 2015, applications for full professorship in Spanish universities (cathedra) involved writing an essay to describe your career and personal views on science. Here is what I wrote to get the condition of **Accredited University Professor** from the official National Evaluation Agency...

    Now (after the positive outcome in July 2015), I upload the version with uncensored pictures, full text, and over 150 hyperlinks!. These are my first words ex-cathedra (even though my salary, as well as the salary of over 2500 colleagues in the same situation, will remain the same for a while unless we do something):

    ## 1. Why a physicist would ever care about Human Vision?

    **Think again: human vision is cool!**

    The leitmotif of my research and teaching activity is the study of **visual information processing in the human brain**. This is a biological and subjective problem: not very appealing adjectives for a "big-bang theory guy." Nevertheless, the aspects of this problem that may be of interest for physicists determined the direction of my scientific career.

    Despite the overuse of the word **multidisciplinary**, you have to consider that **Visual Perception** is a truly multidisciplinary problem. On one hand, the input signal certainly involves plain **Physics** (such as light emission and scattering in everyday scenes, i.e., classical **Radiometry**) and image formation in biological systems (**Physiological Optics**). On the other hand, the analysis of such input signal is a problem for **Neuroscience**, studying natural neural networks for image understanding.

    Human Vision is not limited to classical Optics (Newton's laws), but also involves understanding how the sensors (the visual cortex) process these signals. Explaining visual cortex phenomena requires concepts from **Statistics** and **Information Theory**, or today's jargon, **Machine Learning**. Interestingly, the system being studied (the human brain) can also inspire new mathematical approaches.

    This problem is fascinating for a physicist due to the complex dynamics of the visual brain, where quantitative theories are recent and still under discussion. The study of **Vision** combines experiments, mathematical theories, and technological applications, which aligns with the physicistsâ€™ approach. Vision research involves **Psychology**, **Optometry**, **Neurophysiology** (through **Psycho-Physics**), and applications in **Image Processing** and **Computer Vision**.

    I have made contributions (or introduced some **colored noise** ðŸ˜‰) in most of the disciplines mentioned above over the last 20 years.

    ## 2. Chronological summary of my career

    **While Khun and Marx were kind of wrong, Sinatra was right: I did it my way!**

    (Chronological details of collaborations and scientific progression will be included here, emphasizing the multidisciplinary collaboration throughout my career, including contributions to Optics, Neuroscience, and Engineering.)

    ## 3. My research contributions

    **Colored noise in vision sciences and some thoughts on the h-index**

    My work spans several areas: from **Vision Science** experiments to applications in **Image Processing**. This section includes a breakdown of my contributions, including:

    - Experiments in **Physiological Optics**, **Psychophysics**, and **Image Statistics**.
    - Development of **empirical models** of **Texture**, **Color**, and **Motion Vision**.
    - Formulation of **principled models** of neural adaptation and information transmission.
    - Advancements in **Statistical Learning** and feature extraction techniques.

    (A comprehensive summary of these contributions, with key publications and links, will follow.)

    ## 4. My teaching activities

    **Like Richard Dawkins in a Republican Convention**

    My teaching activities over the last 19 years have been a mix of challenges and rewards, particularly in trying to convey the quantitative aspects of **Vision Science** to **Optometry** students, who typically have non-quantitative inclinations. This section highlights the methodologies and tools I developed to make complex mathematical concepts accessible, including tools like **COLORLAB** and **VirtualNeuroLabs**.

    In addition to teaching **Optometry**, I have also lectured in PhD and Masterâ€™s programs in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**, contributing to the training of future scientists.

    ## 5. Economic constraints of science in Spain

    **Why positive evaluations for professorship do not imply actual positions here?**

    Economic constraints have profoundly affected the scientific landscape in Spain, particularly since the 2008 crisis. Although I have been fortunate enough to build a career, the funding cuts and lack of professorship positions are hindering the career progression of many accredited professors. An **association of accredited professors** has been formed to demand solutions for this blocked career situation, with the support of major worker unions. You can read more about it [here](http://acreditadosacatedra.blogspot.com.es/).

    For further details on each of these sections, including my research contributions and teaching philosophy, I have included over **150 hyperlinks** throughout the text, providing access to my full publications, tools, and additional resources.

    titulo: "[Motion illusions and Entropy](#1-why-a-physicist-would-ever-care-about-human-vision)"
    descripcion: "An example of this surprising behavior is the Static Motion Aftereffect (or the perception of reverse motion after prolonged exposure to a slowly moving pattern -see video-). Physicists like explanations from first principles (the so called laws), and this illusion can be understood according to a law based on communication theory. Sensors that maximize information transmission from sequences happen to have similar frequency tuning to motion sensitive neurons in V1 cortex. For the same efficiency reason, their response is nonlinear, and attenuates in the presence of high contrast moving patterns. Exposure to such patterns induces an operation regime that leads to the illusion while the system readapts to the new situation. Optimal Information Transmission seems to be a law of Human Vision. [Find out more...] It took me 20 years to fully understand that sentence."

    descripcion: "If you are not already convinced of the relation (since you only listen to authority arguments ;-) I have something for you. The New York University (36 Nobel Laureates, wikipedia dixit ;-) organizes its resources in this way: the Physics Department and the Center for Neural Science are in the very same building (both doors in the picture below lead to the same hall, and physiology and theoretical physics labs are interleaved). Moreover, the Courant Institute of Mathematics, famous for its research in Statistical Learning is exactly at the other side of the street (Washington Place)."
