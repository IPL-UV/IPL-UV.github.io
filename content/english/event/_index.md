description : "AI4CS focuses on advancing AI methods to model and understand complex systems, including the visual brain, Earth systems, and socio-environmental interactions. With growing observational data, improved mechanistic models, and advanced machine learning, we can now monitor, predict, and analyze diverse variables. However, current approaches face key challenges: inefficiency with complex data, lack of adherence to physical laws, and limited fundamental insights. AI4CS addresses these issues with innovative, physics-aware, causality-driven AI solutions. This workshop brings together researchers to share advancements, generate new ideas, and promote interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance understanding of interconnected systems and tackle pressing global challenges."
