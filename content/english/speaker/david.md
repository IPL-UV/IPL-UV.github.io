bio: "David Chaparro Danon is a postdoctoral researcher at CREAF. He holds a degree in Biology from the UAB and master's degrees in GIS and Remote Sensing (2012) and Terrestrial Ecology (2013) from UAB-CREAF. He completed his PhD at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) from 2014 to 2018, focusing on the environmental applications of passive microwave sensors in the L-band, such as forest decay and wildfire risk assessment. During his PhD, he conducted a research stay at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. His current research at CREAF focuses on developing algorithms to estimate vegetation water content from satellites, track soil-plant-atmosphere fluxes, and bridge the gap between plant physiology and satellite remote sensing."
