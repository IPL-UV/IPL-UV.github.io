bio: "David Chaparro is a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre de Recerca Ecològica i Aplicacions Forestals (CREAF). He holds degrees in Biology from the UAB, master's degrees in GIS & Remote Sensing and Terrestrial Ecology, and a Ph.D. from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). His research focuses on microwave remote sensing for vegetation monitoring, including forest decay and fire risk assessment. He has contributed to the development of algorithms for estimating vegetation water content and tracking soil-plant-atmosphere fluxes. David has worked at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission and collaborated with MIT as a visiting postdoctoral researcher."
