description: "Agri-environmental systems modeling is about addressing wicked problems, that involve new unprecedented conditions for which we have little experience, let alone observations. Data are sparse, with long tails, highly heterogeneous and noisy. Stakes are contested with value conflicts. Systems are complex, cross-scale interactions between humans, living organisms, and the environment for which we have only partial views. New methodological advancements are necessary towards a tailor-made, hybrid form of AI, able to leverage the power of data together with the extensive knowledge we have of natural systems, and use it for trustworthy decision making and facilitate new scientific discoveries."
