title_topic: "A Flag Decomposition for Hierarchical Datasets"
description: "We will use a block QR decomposition to extract hierarchy-preserving nested sequences of subspaces (a.k.a. Flags). We use this decomposition for hyperspectral image denoising, clustering, and to develop a novel few-shot learning architecture."
