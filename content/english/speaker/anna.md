bio: "Anna Jungbluth is a Research Fellow at the European Space Agency (ESA), where she works in the Climate Team on machine learning applications for Earth Observation. She holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Oxford, where she focused on improving the efficiency of solar panels through charge-transfer state research in organic solar cells. Her passion for machine learning and space research began in 2018 when she won the UK finals of the ESA-sponsored Act in Space Hackathon. She later joined the NASA-funded Frontier Development Lab (FDL), where she worked on machine learning models for solar research. Anna is dedicated to mentorship and actively promotes diversity in STEM fields."
