description: "Clouds represent a major source of uncertainty in Earth system models. In particular, the altitude and vertical distribution of clouds strongly influence their radiative properties and impact Earthâ€™s climate. In this work, we derive 3D cloud maps from 2D satellite imagery and sparse measurements of atmospheric profiles. By encoding space and time, we create a 'geospatially-aware' model with reduced regional prediction biases."

bio: "Anna Jungbluth is a Research Fellow at the European Space Agency (ESA), working in the Climate Team on machine learning applications for Earth Observation. She holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Oxford, where her research focused on enhancing the efficiency of solar panels through charge-transfer state analysis in organic solar cells. Her passion for machine learning and space research began in 2018 when she won the UK finals of the ESA-sponsored Act in Space Hackathon. Later, she contributed to the NASA-funded Frontier Development Lab (FDL), developing machine learning models for solar research. Anna is also committed to mentorship and promoting diversity in STEM fields."
