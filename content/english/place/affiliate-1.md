### Valencia Airport

Valencia International Airport (IATA: VLC, ICAO: LEVC) is located 8 km west of Valencia, between Manises and Cuart de Poblet. It supports regional business and tourism, with a strong focus on international traffic (69% in 2013).

Key destinations include Paris, Palma de Mallorca, Zurich, and Amsterdam, with domestic routes like Madrid and Ibiza showing declines due to European growth. The airport peaked at 5.9 million passengers in 2007, but traffic has fluctuated, with 4.6 million passengers recorded in 2013.

The airport houses Air Nostrum, Vueling, and Ryanair bases, with significant infrastructure updates in 2007 (regional terminal) and 2012 (Terminal 2). Ryanair's presence, managing over 40% of traffic, has been both a strength and source of criticism. Valencia remains a vital hub for passengers and cargo in Spain.
