## Workshop – AI for Complex Systems: Brain, Earth, Climate, Society

- **What:** A 2-day workshop bringing together machine learning and visual neuroscience experts to discuss new methods and common challenges in addressing complexity in the Earth and climate, visual brain, and social systems.
- **Where:** Universitat de València, Valencia, Spain
- **When:** 13th - 15th January 2025

### Why this workshop?

In AI4CS we develop advanced AI methods to model and understand complex systems, focusing on the visual brain, Earth and climate systems, and biosphere-anthroposphere interactions. A perfect storm is over us: 
- An ever-increasing amount of observational and sensory data.
- Improved high-resolution yet mechanistic models are available.
- Advanced machine learning techniques able to extract patterns and identify drivers from data.

In the last decade, machine learning models have helped to monitor, predict, and forecast all kinds of variables and parameters of interest from observational data. They help quantify visual stimuli, monitor land, oceans, and the atmosphere, and study socio-economic variables at different scales and spheres.

Current approaches, however, face three important challenges:
- They cannot deal efficiently with the particular characteristics of data.
- They do not respect the most elementary laws of physics.
- They just interpolate but nothing fundamental is learned from data.

AI4CS aims to address these challenges with innovative, physics-aware, and causality-driven AI solutions to advance our understanding of these interconnected systems.

This workshop will address these goals, bringing together researchers to share progress, brainstorm new ideas, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.
