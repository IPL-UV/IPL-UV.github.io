"Worldfloods" detection model onboard SpaceX’s Falcon rocket launched June 30th! Our script is now flying on a hard-disk at 20,000 km from the Earth! Successfully developed by ISP & Oxford University in partnership with ESA Φ-lab! Who made it possible? Gonzalo Mateo-Garcia, Joshua Veitch-Michaelis, Lewis Smith, Silviu Oprea, Guy Schumann, Yarin Gal, Atılım Güneş Baydin, and Dietmar Backes. Congrats!
