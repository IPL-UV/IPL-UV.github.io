ESA 2022-23 AI4Science DeepExtremes Project Kicked-off! Multi-Hazards, Compounds and Cascade events. We will rely on deep learning to deal with spatio-temporal data, techniques from computer vision for forecasting impacts, and the advanced regression methods for associating impacts on biosphere and society. Understanding what the DL models have learned are of importance here: explainable AI techniques and methods from modern Bayesian inference.
