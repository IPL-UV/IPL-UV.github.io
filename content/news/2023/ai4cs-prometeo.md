AI4CS - GVA PROMETEO 2022-2025 AI for complex systems: Brain, Earth, Climate, Society. We are hosting the first project meeting in person! The aim is to know each other better, find common points of interest and organize activities e.g. workshops, PhD students exchange, research designs, etc. Presentations by Marcelo Bertalm√≠o from CSIC, Luca Martino from URJC, Sancho Salcedo from UAH, Adriano Camps from UPC, Luis Guanter from UPV, and Gustau Camps-Valls, followed by discussions about limitations on the standard model of vision science, imaging and AI, model and feature selection trade-offs, extreme event predictions and diverse AI-relevant Remote Sensing case studies. Interesting problems sparking new collaborations.
