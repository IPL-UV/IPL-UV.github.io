The UV and the ISP gathers in València (Spain) world-renowned experts in two interconnected fields: climate change and artificial intelligence. The meeting is organized by the ELLIS Program ‘Machine Learning for Earth and Climate Sciences’ and the ELISE project, which connect outstanding researchers in these fields across Europe. The discussions will focus on detecting, analyzing, and understanding extreme weather events, such as droughts, heat waves, floods, fires, and hurricanes, and applying artificial intelligence in this context.
