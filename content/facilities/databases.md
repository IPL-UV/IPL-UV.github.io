Given our long standing relations with [ESA](https://esa.int) and [EUMETSAT](https://eumetsat.int) we have a huge library of both real and synthetic time series of archived satellite products including (1) reflectance data (Quickbird, WorldView2, HyMap, SPOT, RapidEye, LandSat, VTG, MODIS and SEVIRI, IASI), and (2) Biophysical products from MODIS, COPERNICUS Global Land, MERIS and LSA SAF. Moreover, we have access to thematic maps and databases on land-cover and land-use (CORINE, SIOSE) and reference databases such as LUCAS and BIOSOIL. Check our [Databases](data.html) section!
