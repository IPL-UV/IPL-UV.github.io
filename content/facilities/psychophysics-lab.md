We have a number of working physiological and psychophysical experimental settings to get relevant measurements in visual neuroscience. At ISP we count with eye tracking systems and colourimetrically calibrated displays to do psychophysics, and thanks to the projects with [Hospital La Fe](https://www.iislafe.es/en/) and [Hospital Clínic](https://www.incliva.es/), we also have access to the fMRI facilities for brain imaging.
