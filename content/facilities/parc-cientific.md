We are at the Parc Científic of the Universitat de València. The IPL is well equipped with space, access to image acquisition equipment and antennae reception of satellite images. The ISP group has the physical space needed for the integration of interns and material provision (computers, office equipment, and standard resources) for training and work. The ISP group has a range of instruments for ground and lab experimentation particularly spectro-radiometers and unique multispectral image acquisition systems developed in a EU-funded project, as well as others designed and manufactured by the group through the last years. Access to internal computer grids and external computer grids (such as Tirant and MareNostrum) is also available.
