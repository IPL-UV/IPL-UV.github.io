Currently, at ISP we have a cluster of 4 interconnected servers with a total of 8 CPUs + 4 GPUs, and another cluster with 24 nodess (2 CPUs Intel Xeon / AMD EPYC each: 48-CPUs + 2 GPUs NVIDIA K40). We have a storage capacity of roughly 100 TB and a small cluster dedicated to the web site. The experimental members from VA and ERS also count with smaller clusters appropriate for data preprocessing and the use of numerical models and huge storage capacity (100 TB). Similar capacities exist in our collaborators. The [ERC-CoG-2015 SEDAL](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/647423/) project scaled this computational power keep it up-to-date. Thanks to the [ERC-SyG-2020 USMILE](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/855187/es) we just started the building of a new cold room with a powerful computer facilities for big EO data analysis.
