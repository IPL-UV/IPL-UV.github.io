We will rely on the framework of kernel learning, which has emerged as the most appropriate framework for remote sensing data analysis in the last decade. The new retrieval models will be adapted to the particular signal characteristics, such as unevenly sampled time series and missing data, non-Gaussianity, presence of heteroscedastic and non-stationary processes, and non-i.i.d. (spatial and temporal) relations.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://ipl-uv.github.io/news/2016/sedal-grant/motivation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ipl-uv.github.io/news/2016/sedal-grant/motivation/</guid><description>Motivation Despite the many successful results and developments, there are still strong limitations for the general adoption of machine learning algorithms for predicting and understanding EO data. Machine learning and signal processing have advanced enormously in the last decade (both at theoretical and applied levels) but have not moved forward the field of EO data analysis to its full potential.
The current statistical treatment of biophysical parameters is strongly limited by the quantity and quality of EO data, as well as by the abuse of standard off-the-shelf methods, which, in general, are not well-adapted to the particular characteristics of EO data.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://ipl-uv.github.io/news/2016/sedal-grant/project_structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ipl-uv.github.io/news/2016/sedal-grant/project_structure/</guid><description>Methodology Activities are organized in three major tasks: two theoretical tasks guided by an application-oriented one dealing with relevant EO problems.
Workpackage 1: Improving Statistical Regression Models We will develop new kernel regression models to cope with the shortcomings identified before, namely: improve model’s accuracy by encoding prior knowledge, quantify the uncertainty of the estimations, attain self-explanatory models, and alleviate the computational cost. We will develop ways to encode prior knowledge about the problem by design of kernels and neural structures able to:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://ipl-uv.github.io/news/2016/sedal-grant/proporsal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ipl-uv.github.io/news/2016/sedal-grant/proporsal/</guid><description>SEDAL Project Proposals B1 Proposal B2 Proposal Interview Slides Reporting Continuous Reporting: 01/09/2015 - 28/02/2017 Mid-term Report: 01/09/2015 - 28/02/2018 Outreach Presentations Advanced Applications in AI (AAA) Algorithms and Analysis (AAA) Applied Analytics for Agriculture (AAA) Atmospheric and Aerial Analysis (AAA) The SEDAL project is an interdisciplinary effort to develop novel statistical learning methods to analyze Earth Observation (EO) satellite data.

SEDAL is an interdisciplinary project that aims to develop novel statistical learning methods to analyze Earth Observation (EO) satellite data. In the last decade, learning models have helped to monitor land, oceans, and atmosphere through the analysis and estimation of climate and biophysical parameters.</description></item></channel></rss>
