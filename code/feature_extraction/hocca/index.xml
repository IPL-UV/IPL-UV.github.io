Inneuroscience, independent component analysis of chromatic naturalimages explains the spatio-chromatic structure of primary corticalreceptive fields in terms of properties of the visual environment.Canonical correlation analysis explains similarly chromatic adaptationto different illuminations. But, as we show in this paper, neither ofthe two methods generalizes well to explain both spatio-chromaticprocessing and adaptation at the same time. We propose a statisticalmethod which combines the desirable properties of independent componentand canonical correlation analysis: It finds independent components ineach data set which, across the two data sets, are related to eachother via linear or higher-order correlations.</description></item></channel></rss>
