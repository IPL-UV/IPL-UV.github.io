They should be in the spectral domain of Sentinel-2 and spatially represent the information when super-resoluting from 10 to 2.5 meters. Since image-pairs that fulfill these criteria are usually not very large, we will also assemble datasets that can serve as pre-training before moving on to the higher-quality datasets due to the large models to be trained.</description></item></channel></rss>
