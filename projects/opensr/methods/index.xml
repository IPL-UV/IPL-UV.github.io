While GANs have been extensively used in image super-resolution, they are unstable due to their very delicate training process. Diffusion models, which are also probabilistic models drawing results from a likelihood distribution, have proven to be easier to train and deliver better results, surpassing other methodologies in many reconstruction metrics. This development has also been noticed in the remote sensing community, with recent super-resolution works switching to diffusion-based SR methodologies.</description></item></channel></rss>
