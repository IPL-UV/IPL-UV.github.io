## **Step 1: 🚀 Getting Started with the Repository**

Before you dive into the code, it's important to know that there are **multiple ways to manage Git repositories**. The most common approach is using Git commands in the terminal, but you can also use **Git GUI tools** like **GitKraken**, which makes it easier to manage repositories visually. GitKraken is a Git client that helps you work with repositories on **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and other platforms. 


### **Option 1: Terminal Approach**

If you prefer working with the command line, follow these steps to clone the repository and create a new branch:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/IPL-UV/IPL-UV.github.io
```
If you'd like to keep a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account for independent work, you can fork the repository first. Forking creates a personal copy of the repository on your account:

1. Go to the [ISP-UV GitHub Repo](https://github.com/IPL-UV/IPL-UV.github.io).
2. Click the Fork button in the top-right corner.
3. After forking, clone your copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/IPL-UV.github.io
```

Now that you have a copy of the repo, let's create a branch for your new page. It's always good practice to create a new branch with a descriptive name. Let's say you're adding a new visitor:

```bash
git switch -c adding-visitor-jose
```
This keeps your changes isolated until you're ready to merge them into the main branch. Always name your branches descriptively to help others understand what you're working on.

### **Option 2: Using GitKraken 🐙**

If you're not comfortable with the command line, or if you just want a more visual way to manage repositories, you can use GitKraken. This tool allows you to perform all Git operations (like cloning, branching, and committing) without writing commands.

With GitKraken, you can:

- Clone the repository visually by providing the URL.
- Create new branches with just a few clicks.
- Stage, commit, and push your changes with an intuitive interface.
- Visualize the entire Git history and manage conflicts easily.

Using GitKraken or similar tools can make Git operations more beginner-friendly and less prone to mistakes.


### **Option 3: Using GitHub Web Interface 🖥️**

If you're looking for a quick and easy way to add or edit `.md` files without using the terminal or a Git GUI tool, you can do it directly on GitHub. This method is especially useful for minor changes or additions.

**Step 1: Navigate to the Repository**

1. Go to the [ISP-UV GitHub Repo](https://github.com/IPL-UV/IPL-UV.github.io).
2. Use the directory structure to find the folder where you want to add or edit the `.md` file. For example, if you're adding a seminar for 2024, navigate to the `content/seminars/2024` folder.


**Step 2: Adding or Editing Files**

- **Adding a New File**:
    1. Once you're in the desired folder, click the `Add File` button in the top-right corner.
    2. Choose `Create new file` to start writing a new `.md` file.
    3. Give the file a descriptive name, such as `seminar2024.md`.
    4. Write the content for your file following the necessary format (e.g., the seminar template).
    5. Once finished, scroll down to the "Commit changes" section.
    6. You can commit directly to the `main` branch or create a new branch for review (recommended for larger changes).

  <img src="./static/images/git2.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./static/images/git4.png" width="100%">
</p>

- **Uploading a New File**:
    1. Once you're in the desired folder, click the `Add File` button in the top-right corner.
    2. Choose `Upload files` from the dropdown menu.
    3. In the next screen, drag and drop your `.md` file into the designated area or click "choose your files" to browse and upload the file from your computer.
    4. After uploading, you'll see the "Commit changes" section at the bottom of the screen.
    5. Add a descriptive commit message explaining what the new file is about.
    6. Choose whether to:
       - **Commit directly** to the `main` branch (if it's a minor change or if you're confident with it).
       - **Create a new branch** for the changes and open a pull request for review (recommended for larger changes).
    7. Click `Commit changes` or `Propose changes` depending on your selection.


<p align="center">
  <img src="./static/images/git1.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./static/images/git3.png" width="45%">
</p>


**Step 3: Committing Your Changes**

1. Add a descriptive commit message to explain what you've changed or added.
2. Choose whether to:
   - **Commit directly** to the `main` branch (if you're confident in your changes and they are minor).
   - **Create a new branch** and open a pull request for review (recommended for larger changes or new content).

3. Once the changes are committed, they will be reflected in the repository. If you've created a pull request, wait for it to be reviewed and merged into the main branch.

This method is simple and doesn't require any local setup, making it perfect for quick edits or minor content additions directly through the GitHub interface!

## **Step 2: 🔧 Making your changes**

Great! Now you're ready to make changes. Here’s how you can add new content to the website. Whether it's for people, projects, or courses, the process is similar.

### **Adding or edit a new Research page (Research section) 🧠**

Research pages are located in the `content/research/` directory and are organized by topics.

#### **Creating a new Research page**

1. Navigate to the [`content/research/`](https://github.com/IPL-UV/IPL-UV.github.io/tree/main/content/research) directory.
2. Create a new folder with the topic name, e.g., `artificial_intelligence`.
3. Inside this folder, create an `_index.md` file to define the main content.

![research1](images/research-1.png)
![research2](images/research-2.png)
![research3](images/research-3.png)

Each file, whether `_index.md` or others, must follow the rules of the models or layouts defined with HUGO. This involves starting with a YAML header. The minimum required is to include a title (`title`), but depending on the layout or section, additional parameters may be necessary. For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Page title"
param1: ""
param2: ""
---
```

**_index.md File Format:**

The file begins with a title, which serves as the main heading. Afterward, you can add your content in Markdown. If you need to review Markdown rules, you can check this [page](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Additionally, you can combine Markdown with HTML structures if necessary. Below is an example for the page created as `artificial_intelligence`.

```yaml
---
title: "Artificial Intelligence"
---

## 🌟 **Research on Artificial Intelligence**

Introduce the related research content here. 

### **Objectives**
- Detail 1
- Detail 2

### **Current projects**
1. Project A
2. Project B
```
![research4](images/research-4.png)
![research5](images/research-5.png)
![research6](images/research-6.png)


To visualize the new content on this page, you first need to make a commit and, if necessary, create a pull request. Once these steps are completed, you can access the content at [isp.uv.es/research/artificial_intelligence](https://isp.uv.es/research/artificial_intelligence/), following the given example.


![research7](images/research-7.png)

#### **Adding an image**

Images for research pages should be placed in the directory `content/assets/images/research/`. Each main page has its own specific folder within this directory.

To insert an image into the page, use the following Markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Image description](path_to_your_image.webp)
```

By default:

- The image will occupy 80% of the container's width.
- It will be centered on the page.

If you need a customized style, use an HTML structure like the example below:

```html
<img src="path_to_your_image.webp" style="width: 50%;">
```

In this example:

- The image's width will be set to 50%.
- You can add additional styles in the style attribute, such as rounded borders, margins, or specific alignment.


#### **Adding multiple images**

To display several images in a single row, use an HTML structure with flexbox. For example:

```html
<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem;">
  <img src="path_to_your_image1.webp" style="width: 30%;">
  <img src="path_to_your_image.webp" style="width: 30%;">
  <img src="path_to_your_image3.webp" style="width: 30%;">
</div>
```

In this example:
- Each image will occupy 30% of the container's width.
- The images will be spaced evenly with a 1rem gap.

If you need to add more images or further customize the layout:
- Adjust the CSS styles as needed.
- Consult your team if additional support is required.

#### **Editing an existing Research page**

1. Navigate to the corresponding directory, e.g., `content/research/philosophy/`.
2. Open the _index.md file.
3. Make the necessary adjustments to the content, such as:
    - Updating text.
    - Adding new images.
    - Modifying parameters in the YAML header.

Since the page structure is already in place, you’ll only need to update or add the desired content. Be sure to:
- Follow Markdown or HTML formatting rules as appropriate.
- Verify the correct location of images and their paths.
- Test the changes locally before pushing them to the production environment.


**Adding subdirectories for specific content**

If you want to create additional routes like [isp.uv.es/research/philosophy/contenido_1](isp.uv.es/research/philosophy/contenido_1) or [isp.uv.es/research/philosophy/contenido_2](isp.uv.es/research/philosophy/contenido_1), you can simply:

1. Navigate to `content/research/philosophy/`.
2. Create a new folder with the desired subdirectory name, e.g., contenido_1 or contenido_2.
3. Inside each newly created folder, add an _index.md file.
4. Follow the steps in Creating a New Research Page to structure and populate the content for each new page.

Example directory structure:

```bash
content/research/philosophy/contenido_1/_index.md
content/research/philosophy/contenido_2/_index.md
```

This allows you to create a hierarchy of pages and organize content in a more granular way.


### **Adding a New Person (People page) 🧑‍🏫**

Let's start with adding a new person to the People section.

First, use Hugo’s archetype to generate the necessary markdown file:

```bash
hugo new content/people/dir_role/nameofperson.md  # Be sure to choose the correct role for dir_role!
```

This will create a new `.md` file in the `content/people/dir_role` directory.

Here are the available options for `dir_role`:

- alumni
- assistant_professors
- associate_professors
- full_professors
- phd_students
- postdocs
- senior_research_scientists
- visitors

Once you’ve created the file, edit the following:

1. Open the file and update the front matter:
    - `title`: The person’s name.
    - `role`: The role (e.g., postdocs, visitors, full professors).
2. Add the person's photo to `assets/images/people/`.

Once the information is complete, Hugo will take care of the layout when the site is built.


Here is the archetype template that will be used for people:

```yaml
---
title: "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"  # Name of person: automatically generated title based on the file name (Mandatory)
role: ""  # Role of the person (e.g., full professors, postdocs, etc.) (Mandatory)
weight: 0  # Used to set the order of appearance (Optional)

```


### **Adding a New Project (Project page) 📝**

Let's start with adding a new project to the Projects section.

First, use Hugo’s archetype to generate the necessary markdown file:

```bash
hugo new content/projects/current/name_of_project.md  # Create new projects in the "current" directory!
```

This will create a new `.md` file in the `content/projects/current` directory.

Here are the available options for where to create new projects:

- current: For ongoing projects.
- past: For completed projects.

**Note:** The folders like `ai4cs` or others contain additional content related to specific projects and are not meant for creating new project entries. Stick to the `current` and `past` folders for adding new projects.


Once you’ve created the file, follow these steps:

1. Open the file and update the front matter:
    - `title`: The project's name.
    - `logo`: Filename of the project logo (located in `/assets/images/projects/`).
    - `pi`: Principal Investigator(s).
    - `uvpi`: University of Valencia Principal Investigator(s).
    - `years`: Duration of the project (e.g., "2020-2023").
    - `website`: Official project website URL.
2. Add the project's logo to `assets/images/projects/`.

Once the information is complete, Hugo will take care of the layout when the site is built.

Here is the archetype template that will be used for projects:

weight: 0  # Weight for ordering projects (lower numbers appear first) (Optional)
---
```


### **Adding a New Course (Courses page) 📚**

Let’s start with adding a new course to the Courses section.

First, use Hugo’s archetype to generate the necessary markdown file:

```bash
hugo new content/courses/name_of_course.md  # This will create a new course in the "courses" directory
```

This will create a new `.md` file in the `content/courses/` directory, where all course files are stored.

Once you’ve created the file, follow these steps:

1. Open the file and update the front matter:
    - title: The course title.
    - img: Image file for the course (located in `/assets/images/courses/`).
    - link: URL to the course material or resource.
    - course_duration: Duration of the course (e.g., "30 hours").
    - instructor: Name(s) of the instructor(s).
2. Add the course image to `assets/images/courses/`.

### **Adding a New Facility (Facilities page) 🏢**

Let’s start with adding a new facility to the Facilities section.

First, use Hugo’s archetype to generate the necessary markdown file:

```bash
hugo new content/facilities/name_of_facility.md  # This will create a new facility in the "facilities" directory
```

This will create a new `.md` file in the `content/facilities/` directory, where all facility entries are stored.


Once you’ve created the file, follow these steps:

1. Open the file and update the front matter:
    - `title`: The facility name.
    - `img`: Image file for the facility (located in `/assets/images/facilities/`).
    - `link`: URL to the facility details or an external resource (if applicable).
2. Add the facility image to `assets/images/facilities/`.

Once the information is complete, Hugo will take care of the layout when the site is built.

link: ""                                      # Link to facility details or external resource (Optional)
---

Add the facility description here
```


### **Adding a New News Article (News page) 📰**

Let’s start with adding a new news article to the News section.

Each news entry is organized by year, as shown in the directory structure. When adding news articles, make sure to place them in the appropriate folder based on the year of publication. For example, articles published in 2024 should go in the `2024` folder.

Here’s how to generate a new news file:

```bash
hugo new content/news/2024/title-of-news.md  # This will create a new news article in the "2024" folder
```

This will create a new `.md` file in the `content/news/2024/` directory. Adjust the year in the path based on the publication year of the news item.

Once you’ve created the file, follow these steps:

1. Open the file and update the front matter:
    - `title`: The news title, automatically generated from the file name.
    - `date`: Automatically set to the current date (or adjust it if needed).
    - `link`: Optional link to the full news article.
    - `img`: Image file for the news (located in `/assets/images/news/` or a full URL).
2. Add the news image to `assets/images/news/`.

Once the information is complete, Hugo will take care of the layout when the site is built.

```yaml
---
title: "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"  # News title, automatically generated based on the file name (Mandatory)
date: "{{ now.Format "2006-01-02" }}"         # Automatically generated current date in format YYYY-MM-DD (Mandatory)
link: ""                                      # Link to the full news article (Optional)
img: ""                                       # Image file name or URL (Mandatory)
---

Add the news content here
```

### **Adding a New Seminar (Seminars page) 🎤**

Let’s start with adding a new seminar to the Seminars section.

Each seminar is organized by year, as shown in the directory structure. When adding seminars, make sure to place them in the appropriate folder based on the year of the event. For example, seminars in 2024 should be placed in the `2024` folder.

Here’s how to generate a new seminar file:

```bash
hugo new content/seminars/2024/title-of-seminar.md  # This will create a new seminar in the "2024" folder
```

This will create a new `.md` file in the `content/seminars/2024/` directory. Adjust the year in the path based on the seminar's event date.

Once you’ve created the file, follow these steps:

1. Open the file and update the front matter:
    - `title`: The seminar title, automatically generated from the file name.
    - `date`: Automatically set to the current date (or adjust it if needed).
    - `speaker`: Name of the speaker.
    - `affiliation`: Speaker's affiliation (optional).
    - `link`: Optional link to seminar materials or an external resource.
    - `img`: Image file for the seminar (located in `/assets/images/seminars/` or a full URL).
2. Add the seminar image to `assets/images/seminars/` if applicable.

Once the information is complete, Hugo will take care of the layout when the site is built.

Here is the archetype template that will be used for seminars:

```yaml
---
title: "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"  # Seminar title, automatically generated based on the file name (Mandatory)
date: "{{ now.Format "2006-01-02" }}"         # Automatically generated current date in format YYYY-MM-DD (Mandatory)
speaker: ""                                   # Speaker name (Mandatory)
affiliation: ""                               # Speaker's affiliation (Optional)
link: ""                                      # Link to seminar materials or external resource (Optional)
img: ""                                       # Image file name or URL (Optional)
---
```


### **Step 3: Adding Images to Assets**

Whenever you want to add new images to the site, place them in the appropriate directory under `assets/images/`. The folder structure in `assets/images/` should match the name of the main sections of the website (e.g., people, projects, etc.). Images should preferably be in `.webp` format for better performance.

You don’t need to provide the full path when referencing images in the content. Just specify the image file name and its extension.

## **Step 4: 👀 Testing Your Changes Locally**

Before submitting your changes, it’s a good idea to test them locally.

To do this, you need to have Hugo installed. If you don’t have it yet, follow the [Hugo installation guide](https://gohugo.io/installation/).


Once Hugo is set up, you can start the local server with:

```bash
hugo server
```

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:1313` to see your changes live!

## **Step 5: ✅ Pushing Your Changes**

If everything looks good, it’s time to push your changes and submit a pull request.

1. Stage your changes:
```bash
git add .
```

2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "Added new visitor: Jose"
```

3. Push your branch:
```bash
git push origin adding-visitor-jose
```
Now head over to GitHub and open a pull request (PR) for your branch. Once your PR is approved and merged, your changes will be live on the website! 🎉


# **Final Words 🌟**

And that's it! You've just learned how to contribute to the ISP website. Whether you're adding new people, projects, or courses, this guide should give you everything you need to get started.

Happy coding, and welcome to the team! 🥳



---

# Working Directly on GitHub

Another simple approach to working with the ISP website is editing files directly on GitHub. This method is especially useful for quick changes, like editing text or adding new content, without having to clone the entire repository or set up a local development environment.

To edit or add a new file:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub: ISP-UV GitHub Repo.
2. Go to the directory where you'd like to make changes.
3. Click on the file you want to edit or the Add File button to create a new one.
4. Once you're done, click Commit changes and optionally start a pull request.

This method is fast and doesn't require installing any programs, but it’s best suited for small edits.



# Pull Requests: Why They're Important 💡
Once you've made changes in your branch, whether locally or directly on GitHub, the next step is to create a pull request (PR).

A pull request is a way to notify other collaborators that you're ready to merge your changes into the main project. It also gives others the opportunity to review and discuss your code before it gets merged. This is essential in ensuring that:

- Changes are properly tested.
- There are no conflicts with other parts of the project.
- The quality of the project remains consistent.

When you push your branch to GitHub, you’ll be prompted to create a pull request:

```bash
git push origin adding-visitor-jose
```

Then, on GitHub, navigate to the Pull Requests tab and open a new PR.

**💬 Pro Tip:** Pull requests are also a great place to ask questions, point out issues, or request feedback from your team members!
